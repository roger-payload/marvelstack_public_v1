Below, we will provide a detailed introduction to the balance adjustments in the first half of Season 1!", "fullContent": "Hello, Rivals!\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs Season 0 draws to a close, our analysis of battle data has revealed significant shifts in team compositions within regular matches, showcasing a vibrant diversity of lineups.\n\nHowever, as the skill level escalates, compositions centered around double shields and ranged have displayed considerable prowess. Despite this, players have continuously honed and experimented with new compositions and strategies, further enriching the battlefield. For example, a potent combination featuring Psylocke and Star-Lord has brought unparalleled map control through high mobility and formidable mid-range damage, while pairings like Namor and Winter Soldier emphasized defensive counterattacks, fortifying the rear lines and seizing opportunities for combat advantage. Whether formations revolved around Hulk's might or Adam Warlock's team-up abilities or a selection of heroes tailored for specific scenarios, it became clear that players are delving deeper into the world of Marvel Rivals.\u00a0\n\nHence, in the first half of Season 1, we are set to make balance adjustments to certain heroes, enabling a broader roster to partake in more intricate gameplay, ensuring a richer, more engaging, and diverse gaming experience for all.\n\nAt the same time, regarding Season Bonuses and Team-Ups, we'd like to clarify that given the brief duration of Season 0 and everyone's recent acclimatization to Marvel Rivals, we will not make extensive changes to or adjust Team-Up abilities in Season 1.

We're here to give you the scoop on Version 20241210's updates!", "fullContent": "Greetings, Rivals! We're here to give you the scoop on Version 20241210's updates!\n\nWe noticed that some spots on the edge of the new map would cause characters to become stuck. We've had a look at the entire map and have done our best to fix this bug. However, further adjustments may still be needed to fully resolve the issue, so we ask for your understanding while we continue looking into it and working on a way to prevent this from happening again.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the details!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nALL PLATFORMS\n\n\nGENERAL\n\n\u00b7 When playing highlights and recordings, crosshair deviation would be significant, and there was a possibility for lag. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00b7 Changing where Highlights were saved would cause the game to crash. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00b7 Players joining a Quick Match as a replacement may not be able to see heroes' equipped costumes. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00b7 Mission progress on the Season Event screen would not display correctly. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00b7 Fixed some textual errors. More fixes will be coming in a future update.\n\u00b7 After a crash, the game had a chance to freeze for a long period of time before closing. This issue has been resolved, and now the game will close after crashing.\n\u00b7 Fixed some relatively common crash issues.\u00a0\n\n\nMAPS & GAME MODES\n\n\u00b7 On certain maps (particularly Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven and Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface), special collisions on the edges would cause the player's character to become stuck or clip through and enter strange areas. These issues have been largely resolved, but as this affects multiple maps and areas, this bug may be present elsewhere. We will work to continue fixing such issues and develop a solution to thoroughly prevent them.\n\n\u00b7 In the foggy areas of Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Hall of Djalia and Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Birnin T'Challa:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - Fog would disappear from Hela and Storm's perspectives when they activated their Ultimates. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - After Jeff the Land Shark was revived while in the fog, his teammates and enemies would not be able to see the special effects of Joyful Splash. This issue has been resolved.\n\n\u00b7 In Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven - Frozen Airfield:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - In Competitive, if a player was KO\u2019d while moving near a target area, it would cause the lightings to behave abnormally. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - During matches, disconnecting and reconnecting could cause desynchronization of some doors (i.e., a door looked to be closed, but the player could walk through; a door looked to be open, but the player couldn't walk through). This issue has been resolved.\n\n\u00b7 Hydra Charteris Base: Hell's Heaven - Eldritch Monument:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Adam Warlock used his Ultimate, his teammates would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Thor or Loki were revived by Hela's team-up ability, they would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Jeff the Land Shark used his Ultimate to devour characters, they would potentially become stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Winter Soldier hit an enemy with his Ultimate and they landed right on the target area platform, damage may be lost. This issue has been resolved.\n\n\u00b7 When switching between rounds in Competitive, if the destination was not the last stage of a map, it would cause the vehicle's effective range to not display when it approached the destination, impacting determination of the effective occupation range. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00b7 Upon reaching the third round in Competitive Convoy or Convergence, heroes had a chance to carry over their Ultimate energy from the second round. This issue has been resolved, and heroes will no longer inherit their Ultimate energy.\u00a0\n\n\nHEROES\n\n\u00b7 When Wolverine had his Deadpool & Wolverine costume equipped, no ability voice lines other than the Undying Animal ability's line would play. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00b7 After Star-Lord's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3's MVP animation played, sound effects would not be played in the results screen. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00b7 When Iron Fist used pings, the corresponding voice lines would not be triggered. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00b7 The description for ADS sensitivity in Black Widow's settings was incorrect. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00b7 In certain situations, Black Widow's Ultimate would not recover energy as intended. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00b7 In certain extreme situations, Captain America's Ultimate wouldn't end as intended. This issue has been resolved.\n\u00b7 When Doctor Strange's portals triggered terrain KOs, they would mistakenly restore Doctor Strange's Ultimate energy. For now, we have disabled the portals' terrain KO attribution to temporarily fix this issue (i.e., terrain KOs will not count toward Doctor Strange's own KOs). Rest assured, this bug will be resolved in a future update, at which time we will restore the portals' KO attribution.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nPC\n\n\u00b7 Using FSR 3 frame generation technology to modify the resolution could cause memory leaks, resulting in blurry models. This issue has been resolved.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n\nCONSOLE\n\n\u00b7 After equipping the PlayStation bundle's Scarlet Spider costume, restarting the game could cause the costume to not display as correctly equipped. This issue has been resolved.\n\n\nWe'll be keeping an eye on the frequency of different bugs and fixing them as fast as we can.
